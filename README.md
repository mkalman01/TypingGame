# Random questions
Creating a typing test application using the MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) stack is a great choice. It will allow you to build a full-stack web application with a database for storing the data and a frontend interface for users to take the typing test.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Set up the backend:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.
Initialize a new Node.js project: npm init -y.
#I have initialized the nodejs project - done

Install the necessary dependencies: npm install express mongoose.
#I have installed the dependencies - done

Set up Express.js to handle HTTP requests and MongoDB (or any other database) for data storage.

Define the necessary routes for your application, such as handling user authentication, saving test results, and retrieving leaderboard data.

Connect to your MongoDB database using Mongoose and define a schema for storing test results.

Set up the frontend:

Create a new directory for the frontend code and navigate to it in the terminal.
Set up a Vue.js project: npm install -g @vue/cli and vue create ..
Choose the default preset or manually select features that you need.
Install additional dependencies: npm install axios vue-router.
Set up Vue Router to handle client-side routing for different pages in your application.

Create the necessary Vue components for the typing test, leaderboard, and other UI elements.

Implement the logic to fetch code snippets from GitHub repositories based on the chosen programming language.

Integrate the backend with the frontend:

In your Vue.js components, use Axios to make HTTP requests to the backend API and retrieve the code snippets.
Implement the typing test functionality, including word per minute (WPM) calculation, accuracy calculation, and timing.
Send the test results to the backend and store them in the database.
Implement a leaderboard page that fetches and displays the test results from the database.
Style and enhance the UI:

Use CSS or a UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Vuetify) to style your application and make it visually appealing.
Add any additional features you desire, such as user authentication, user profiles, and test customization options.
Deploy your application:

Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) to deploy your backend and frontend.
Set up the necessary configurations and deploy your application to the chosen hosting provider.
Remember to handle error cases, validate user inputs, and ensure the security of your application, especially when dealing with user authentication and database interactions.

This guide provides a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating a typing test application using the MEVN stack. It's important to note that the implementation details can vary based on your specific requirements and preferences. Make sure to consult the documentation of each technology you're using for more detailed information and examples.
